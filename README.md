# EMF-Visualization-Optimization
The goal of this software is to use software and physics based modelling to represent the EMF (Electro Motive Force) produced by a coil. Then use gradient descent to optimize for either maxima field strength in a given formfactor, or optimize for flux density for a given field strength.
